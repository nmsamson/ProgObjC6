//  Chapter 5, Exercise 2
//    A triangular number can also be generated for any integer value of n by this formula:
//      triangularNumber = n (n + 1) / 2
//    For example, the 10th triangular number, 55, can be calculated by substituting 10 as the value for n
//    into the previous formula. Write a program that generates a table of triangular numbers using the
//    previous formula. Have the program generate every fifth traingular number between 5 and 50 (that is, 5, 10, 15, ... 50).
